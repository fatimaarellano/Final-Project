          <p>Pick up your head<br>look me in the eyes<br>And see the world<br>But...don't look so sad</p>
          <p>The longing in your eyes<br>The pain that once residedin your past<br>The beautiful smile lost in the mirror<br>
           Fat, ugly, skinny, the voices in my head<br>they have names, Sue..<br>Ana, and Deb<br>Am I normal?</p>
          <p>Out of place<br>No happy memories<br>There are chains hagign over my voice<br>Swords coming at me form every direction
          <br>Mental illness don't exist<br>It is just in your head just think positive<br>Put on a facade</p>
          <p>I'm getting better I'm happy<br>There is no pain<br>I love myself<br>A beautiful lie covers me in a.....<br>
           Pile of mask and a never ending world<br>You want me to be okay<br>I am...I guess</P>
          <p>The happy girl yu once knew is nowhere to be found<br>Am I pretty yet?<br>Am I good enough yet?<br>Am I there yet?<br>
           I'm slowly breaking down...<br>I don't know who I am anymore<br>I feel like a canary caged in<br>The door is opened but...</P>
           <p>i have no motivation to get out.<br>It's as if my feet are cemented onto the cage<br>Every door to freedom can be opened<br>they can be so close but<br>
            I won't be able to get out.</p>
            <p>I tell myself that<br>I'm happy<br>it shows but only for a few moments<br> I'm constantly tyring to be conformed with life<br>Trying to not harm those
              around<br>Or...myself.<br>But I guess in the end<br> I Am Okay</p>

      <h2>2.</h2>
      <p>You say you love me<br>Yet you treat me like I don’t exist<br>For that I don’t know why….<br>I can’t get you out of my head.</p>
             <p>For some odd reason<br>My head says no<br>My heart says yes<br>The people around me see you as a jerk<br>But I don’t seem to understand</p>
             <p>It’s as if you made me fall for you and then put blindfolds on me<br>So that I could back you up till it fell off.</p>
             <p>Its as if I love you were a lie<br>Did you lie to me when you hugged me and said, “I’ll be there for you”?<br>Or “they have to get through me first.”</p>
             <p>Maybe it was just child’s play<br>Maybe it was all just a dream<br>Maybe it wasn’t a lie but an experiment<br>Maybe if it hadn’t happened this feeling would’ve never been here.</p>

            <p>I haven’t been feeling much lately<br>I’m not numb<br>I just.. I don’t know<br>A lot of people tell me I look happy
              <br>I should keep it up<br>It’s nice to see me smile</p>
             <p>I wish I could show the world my genuine smile<br>At the moment it is nowhere to be found<br>Living life because I have to not because I want to
               <br>I am in a time machine that is stuck in the past<br>The present has been erased<br>The future is gone, seemingly impossible</p>
             <p>“You have grown, we see so much progress” <br>I suppose I will lock up the pandora box again, <br>Suppress it, avoid it
               <br>Never looking back, because if I do the “progress” will be gone</p>
               <p>Watch the sky <br>It’s beautiful how the clouds move in one direction<br>As if they always know where they are going<br>All in different shapes
                 <br>Shapeshifting into forms unknown to them <br>I wish I could shapeshift out of my own skin<br>Mold it and perfect it<br>Not to the point where everything seems like plastic
                 <br>But I want to make it safe again</p>
                 <p>My body and soul reject each other<br>How am I supposed to pretend I am fine?<br>There is war rumbling inside of me<br>One can only see the chaos shown
                   <br>Not the reality under the lock.<br>I have urges to participate in things that..<br>I would usually object to<br>I have a need to get high or drunk
                   <br>Stop don’t listen<br>My soul is trying to pull me away<br>Be you, the one I know<br>I don’t know if she still exists<br>I’m sorry
                   <br>I’m so sorry<br>I wonder if I can ever repair myself <br>Be the one people love<br>So far all that can mustered up is self hate</p>
                   <p>I’m confident or that’s how it seems<br>I’m a badass, that’s my appearance talking<br>I look kept together and can totally make your day
                     <br>I’m the weird hyper girl <br>The one that is always smiling<br>The one who is gullible and easily flustered<br>Everyone believes my cover
                     <br>I don’t know who I truly am<br>I’m a work in progress stuck in a broken time machine.</p>
