      <p><strong>ABOUT:</strong><br>Hello, I suppose by now you may think wow she is really depressed. Yes I am, besides the point. Let's say I am someone very shy yet very talkative at the same time,
        to the point where people want me to be quiet. I don't verbally express myself, which led me to be more artistically inclined. Painting, mixing materials into a piece,
        or drawing with no real plan or structure, singing my lungs out to the world, or playing horrible violin, or ranting and then picking and choosing sections for poetry,
        although verbal communication is something I do frequently, the other forms of communition represent me. Currently I have no job, I am taking a semester off, and I am
        finally out of the hospital setting, some people think that I am less than them because I have a mental illness. Yet taking this time off to heal and become someone who
        I am proud of being is prove that I am an equal to or better than those trying to put me down. Who am I? Honestly I don't know, that is exactly what I am trying to find out.
        I am in the process of recovery and I am not afraid to tell the world my story, although I do have a slight problem communicating with people since I speak in circles.
        Anyways welcome to a sneak peak into who I am, what I love and small moments in my life that are really important to me.

    <p><strong>ABOUT:</strong><br>Hello, though I am not the main person in this portfolio, I would like to introduce myself. I am a soon to be graduate with an associates degree in New Media
      Technology with a concentration on digital media. Though my concentration is computer based I do enjoy drawing on my free time. My skills include public speech, child care, and creative thinking.
      Am also bilingual in english and spanish. I am also currently unemployed and currently not looking but open to accept offers. I have social anxiety but that does not intervene when it comes to
      getting something done. I also suffer from depression but now I am doing much better than the past years. I probably don't talk as much as other people but I don't mind working with others and I know
      how to interact with different people. If you would like to know more about me or my work please contact me.</p>
      <p><strong>Cell Number:</strong>1(646)752-0240 *please text me, as I sometimes can't answer phone calls*
